# Core Service Fixes Summary

This document summarizes all the fixes applied to resolve the startup and runtime errors in the `services/core` application.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Configuration Structure Issues
**Problem**: GlobalConfig was missing `redis`, `service`, and `database` attributes that were being accessed throughout the code.

**Solution**: 
- Added properties to `GlobalConfig` class that return appropriate sub-configuration objects
- Created `DatabaseConfig`, `AuthConfig`, `RedisConfig`, and `ServiceConfig` classes
- Added proper property methods to access these configurations

**Files Modified**: `services/core/config.py`

### 2. ServiceRegistry Missing Department Service
**Problem**: Code was trying to access `services.department` which didn't exist in the ServiceRegistry.

**Solution**:
- Created `DepartmentService` class with methods for department management
- Added department service to the ServiceRegistry initialization
- Implemented proper CRUD operations for departments

**Files Modified**: `services/core/services.py`

### 3. Pydantic Model Version Warning
**Problem**: Field `model_version` conflicted with Pydantic's protected namespace, causing warnings.

**Solution**:
- Renamed `model_version` fields to `analysis_model_version` in both models and schemas
- Updated all references to use the new field name

**Files Modified**: 
- `services/core/schemas.py`
- `services/core/models.py`

### 4. JSON Serialization Error
**Problem**: DateTime objects in error responses weren't JSON serializable.

**Solution**:
- Replaced `.dict()` calls with `model_dump_json()` in middleware error handling
- Added proper JSON serialization using Pydantic's built-in methods
- Created custom datetime serializer function

**Files Modified**: `services/core/middleware.py`

### 5. Pydantic v2 Compatibility
**Problem**: Code was using deprecated `from_orm()` method and `dict()` calls.

**Solution**:
- Replaced all `from_orm()` calls with `model_validate()`
- Updated `.dict()` calls to use `model_dump()` with fallback
- Ensured compatibility with both Pydantic v1 and v2

**Files Modified**: 
- `services/core/services.py`
- `services/core/main.py`
- `services/core/database.py`

### 6. Repository Pattern Updates
**Problem**: BaseRepository was using deprecated Pydantic methods.

**Solution**:
- Updated `create()` and `update()` methods to handle both Pydantic v1 and v2
- Added proper error handling for different input types
- Maintained backward compatibility

**Files Modified**: `services/core/database.py`

### 7. Database Manager Initialization
**Problem**: Global database manager instances weren't properly initialized.

**Solution**:
- Verified proper initialization of `db_manager` and `redis_manager`
- Ensured correct imports and dependency injection
- Fixed async context management

**Files Modified**: `services/core/database.py`, `services/core/main.py`

### 8. Database SSL/sslmode Connection Error ⭐ NEW
**Problem**: AsyncPG driver doesn't support `sslmode` parameter, causing "connect() got an unexpected keyword argument 'sslmode'" error.

**Solution**:
- Added URL parsing to remove incompatible SSL parameters (`sslmode`, `sslcert`, `sslkey`, `sslrootcert`)
- Implemented proper SSL handling for asyncpg with ssl context
- Added fallback SSL configuration for development environments
- Enhanced error handling and logging for database connections
- Created database connection test script for debugging

**Files Modified**: 
- `services/core/database.py`
- `services/core/main.py`
- `services/core/env_example.txt`
- `services/core/test_db_connection.py` (new)

## Configuration Requirements

To run the application, ensure these environment variables are set:

```env
# Database (IMPORTANT: Don't include sslmode in URL)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/mental_health_db

# Authentication
AUTH_SECRET_KEY=your-super-secret-jwt-key-change-this-in-production

# Redis
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379/0

# Service Configuration
SERVICE_NAME=mental-health-analytics
SERVICE_VERSION=2.0.0
SERVICE_HOST=0.0.0.0
SERVICE_PORT=8000

# Other required variables as per env_example.txt
```

## Testing the Fixes

After applying these fixes, the application should:
1. Start without configuration errors
2. Initialize database and Redis connections properly
3. Handle requests without JSON serialization errors
4. Work with both Pydantic v1 and v2
5. Provide proper error responses with request IDs
6. Connect to PostgreSQL databases without SSL parameter conflicts

### Database Connection Testing

You can test the database connection using the provided test script:

```bash
cd services/core
python test_db_connection.py
```

## Key Improvements

1. **Better Error Handling**: All error responses now include request IDs and proper JSON serialization
2. **Configuration Management**: Centralized and properly structured configuration system
3. **Pydantic Compatibility**: Full compatibility with both Pydantic v1 and v2
4. **Type Safety**: Improved type hints and proper model validation
5. **Code Organization**: Better separation of concerns with proper service layer
6. **Database Compatibility**: Proper handling of PostgreSQL connections with asyncpg driver
7. **SSL Support**: Appropriate SSL configuration for both development and production

The application should now start and run without the errors shown in the original error logs. 

## Security Vulnerability Fixes Summary

This document summarizes the security vulnerabilities that were identified and fixed in the project's Python dependencies.

### Vulnerabilities Found

- **fastapi==0.104.1**: A high-severity ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service) vulnerability.
- **starlette==0.27.0**: Affected by multiple vulnerabilities, including a critical vulnerability related to how multipart/form-data parts are handled (CVE-2024–47874) and a Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability (GHSA-f96h-pmfr-66vw).
- **python-multipart==0.0.6**: Vulnerable to a ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service) vulnerability (CVE-2024-24762).

### Actions Taken

1.  **Identified all `requirements.txt` files**: All `requirements.txt` files in the project were located to ensure all services were patched.
2.  **Updated Vulnerable Packages**: The following packages were updated to secure versions in all relevant `requirements.txt` files:
    - `fastapi` was updated to `0.111.0`.
    - `starlette` was updated to `0.37.2`.
    - `python-multipart` was updated to `0.0.9`.
3.  **Updated Other Packages**: The following packages were also updated to their latest versions for consistency and to prevent potential future issues:
    - `uvicorn` was updated to `0.30.1`.
    - `pydantic` was updated to `2.7.1`.
    - `pydantic-core` was updated to `2.18.2`.
4.  **Pinned Dependencies**: Unpinned dependencies in several `requirements.txt` files were pinned to ensure reproducible builds and prevent accidental installation of vulnerable packages.
5.  **Cleaned up `requirements.txt` files**: Duplicate entries were removed from `services/stt/api/requirements.txt`.

All identified security vulnerabilities have been addressed. The project's dependencies are now more secure and maintainable.
