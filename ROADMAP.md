# 🚀 Project Roadmap

This document outlines the planned enhancements and future directions for the Integrated Multi-Modal Emotion & Mental State Analyzer.

---

## 🔁 Integration
- **Common API Gateway:**
  - Use FastAPI or Express.js as a unified gateway to route requests to the appropriate model or service, simplifying client integration and deployment.
- **Queue-based Communication:**
  - For better scalability and reliability, integrate a message queue system (e.g., RabbitMQ or Redis Queue) to handle asynchronous processing and load balancing between services.

## 🧠 ML Model Enhancements
- **Model Versioning:**
  - Implement model versioning and experiment tracking using tools like MLflow or DVC, enabling easy rollback, comparison, and reproducibility.
- **Domain-Specific STT:**
  - Improve the Speech-to-Text (STT) pipeline by training custom models on domain-specific data for higher accuracy and relevance.

## 🔒 Security
- **API Token-based Authentication:**
  - Secure all endpoints with token-based authentication (e.g., JWT) to control access and protect sensitive data.
- **Rate Limiting & Input Sanitization:**
  - Prevent abuse and attacks by implementing rate limiting and thorough input validation/sanitization.

## 📊 Analytics & Monitoring
- **Logging for Model Improvement:**
  - Log user input and model output (with privacy in mind) to gather data for continuous model improvement and error analysis.
- **Monitoring Dashboard:**
  - Integrate Prometheus and Grafana to monitor API/model load, latency, and uptime, providing real-time operational insights.
