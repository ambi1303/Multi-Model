# Emo Buddy & STT Services Audit & Fixes Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the comprehensive audit and fixes applied to restore full functionality to the EmoBuddy and STT services, ensuring proper database integration through the core service.

## Issues Identified & Fixed

### 1. STT Service Authentication Issues ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: STT service was attempting to call core service APIs without proper authentication, causing all database storage operations to fail.

**Solution**:
- Added service account token mechanism in core service
- Updated STT service to use `SERVICE_AUTH_TOKEN` environment variable
- Implemented proper JWT token handling for inter-service communication
- Updated authentication middleware to handle service tokens

**Files Modified**:
- `services/stt/api/main.py` - Added authentication headers and token management
- `services/core/services.py` - Added `create_service_token()` method
- `services/core/middleware.py` - Updated to handle service tokens
- `services/core/main.py` - Added service token creation endpoint

### 2. STT Service Data Payload Issues ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: STT service was sending incorrectly formatted data that didn't match the core service schema expectations.

**Solution**:
- Fixed emotion scores format to match `SpeechAnalysisCreate` schema
- Added proper data type conversions (strings to uppercase, floats conversion)
- Improved emotion data handling for both list and dict formats
- Added audio duration calculation and metadata

**Files Modified**:
- `services/stt/api/main.py` - Fixed payload transformation in `store_analysis_in_db()`

### 3. EmoBuddy Service Database Integration ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: EmoBuddy service was using only in-memory session storage with no database persistence.

**Solution**:
- Integrated EmoBuddy service with core database through API calls
- Added core session creation and message storage functionality
- Maintained in-memory agents for processing logic while persisting to database
- Added proper error handling for database operations

**Files Modified**:
- `services/emo_buddy/api.py` - Complete rewrite with database integration
- Added `create_core_session()` and `add_message_to_core_session()` functions

### 4. Core Service API Enhancements ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Core service APIs needed to support service-to-service communication.

**Solution**:
- Added service token authentication mechanism
- Updated EmoBuddy endpoints to handle service calls with user_id parameters
- Enhanced authentication middleware for service tokens
- Added proper dependency injection for mixed user/service calls

**Files Modified**:
- `services/core/main.py` - Updated EmoBuddy endpoints, added service token creation
- `services/core/middleware.py` - Enhanced authentication for service calls
- `services/core/services.py` - Added service token methods

### 5. STT-EmoBuddy Integration ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: STT service wasn't properly storing EmoBuddy session data in the database.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced STT service to create EmoBuddy sessions in core database
- Added proper session tracking between in-memory agents and database UUIDs
- Implemented message storage for both user input and bot responses
- Added session cleanup and management

**Files Modified**:
- `services/stt/api/main.py` - Added EmoBuddy database integration functions

### 6. Environment Configuration & Security ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Missing proper configuration for inter-service communication and authentication.

**Solution**:
- Added service token generation script
- Created environment configuration templates
- Added proper error handling for missing tokens
- Enhanced health check endpoints to show configuration status

**Files Created**:
- `generate_service_token.py` - Script to create service tokens
- Enhanced health endpoints in all services

## New Features Added

- Long-lived service tokens (1 year expiration)
- Admin-only token generation
- Secure token validation

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling
- Comprehensive error logging
- Graceful degradation when services are unavailable
- Proper HTTP status codes and error messages
- Timeout handling for network operations

### 3. Database Integration Verification
- Real-time session tracking
- Proper UUID management between services
- Message persistence with metadata
- Session lifecycle management

### 4. Testing & Validation
- Integration test script for end-to-end validation
- Service health monitoring
- Database connectivity verification
- Token validation testing

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Generate Service Tokens
```bash
python generate_service_token.py
```
This will:
- Prompt for admin credentials
- Generate tokens for all services
- Optionally save tokens to service .env files

### 2. Environment Variables
Add to each service's `.env` file:
```bash
# For STT service
SERVICE_AUTH_TOKEN=<generated_token>
CORE_SERVICE_URL=http://localhost:8000

# For EmoBuddy service  
SERVICE_AUTH_TOKEN=<generated_token>
CORE_SERVICE_URL=http://localhost:8000

# For Core service
DATABASE_URL=<your_database_url>
AUTH_SECRET_KEY=<your_secret_key>
```

### 3. Start Services
```bash
# Start core service first
cd services/core && python main.py

# Start STT service
cd services/stt/api && python main.py

# Start EmoBuddy service
cd services/emo_buddy && python api.py
```

### 4. Run Integration Tests
```bash
python test_integration.py
```

## Architecture Improvements

### 1. Service Communication Flow
```
STT Service ──────────────────┐
    │                         │
    │ (Service Token)          │
    ▼                         ▼
Core Database ◄─────── Core Service ◄─────── EmoBuddy Service
    │                         ▲
    │                         │ (Service Token)
    │                         │
    └─────────────────────────┘
```

### 2. Data Flow
1. **Speech Analysis**: STT → Core DB (speech_analyses table)
2. **EmoBuddy Session**: STT → Core Service → Core DB (emo_buddy_sessions + messages)
3. **Session Tracking**: In-memory agents linked to database UUIDs
4. **Message Persistence**: All interactions stored with proper metadata

### 3. Authentication Chain
1. User authenticates with Core Service
2. Services authenticate with Service Tokens
3. Core Service validates all requests
4. Database operations logged and tracked

## Testing Results

The integration tests verify:
- ✅ STT service can process audio and store results
- ✅ EmoBuddy service can create and manage sessions
- ✅ Database integration works end-to-end
- ✅ Service authentication is properly configured
- ✅ Error handling works correctly

## Performance Improvements

1. **Reduced Database Calls**: Efficient session management
2. **Better Error Recovery**: Services can handle temporary failures
3. **Proper Connection Pooling**: Database connections managed properly
4. **Async Operations**: Non-blocking database calls

## Security Enhancements

1. **Service Token Authentication**: Secure inter-service communication
2. **Token Validation**: Proper JWT validation and expiration
3. **User Authorization**: Proper access control for user data
4. **Audit Logging**: All operations logged for security

## Maintenance & Monitoring

### Health Checks
All services now provide detailed health information:
```bash
GET /health
```
Returns:
- Service status
- Database connectivity
- Token configuration
- Active sessions (where applicable)

### Logging
Enhanced logging across all services:
- Request/response logging
- Error details with stack traces
- Performance metrics
- Database operation status

### Troubleshooting
Common issues and solutions:
1. **Service Token Missing**: Run token generation script
2. **Database Connection Failed**: Check DATABASE_URL in core service
3. **Authentication Errors**: Verify tokens are correctly configured
4. **Integration Failures**: Run integration test script for diagnostics

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur, rollback steps:
1. Revert to previous service versions
2. Use in-memory storage temporarily
3. Disable database integration features
4. Fall back to standalone service mode

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements:
1. Redis integration for session caching
2. Enhanced analytics and reporting
3. Real-time notifications
4. Advanced error recovery mechanisms
5. Performance optimization
