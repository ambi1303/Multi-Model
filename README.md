- [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) installed and available in your PATH (required for audio conversion)

#### Install dependencies
```bash
cd integrated/backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Run the backend
```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 9000
```

### 2. Frontend

#### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+

#### Install dependencies
```bash

## Usage

- Open the frontend in your browser.
- Use the tabs to switch between Video, Speech, Chat, and Survey analyzers.
- Each tab provides a modern, user-friendly interface for its respective modality.

---

## Notes
- The backend uses the Vosk model for speech recognition. The model files are included in `integrated/backend/vosk-model-small-en-us-0.15/`.
- For best results, ensure your microphone and webcam are working and accessible by your browser.
- All legacy services (in `stt/`, `survey/`, etc.) are now integrated and no longer need to be run separately.
